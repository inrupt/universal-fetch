# Web application project template for Inrupt projects

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install, then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. To change the
port from the default of 3000, use the `-p` option on the `dev` script in your `package.json`, for
example to change our app to use port 3001 instead:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p 3001",
    :
  },
  :
}
```

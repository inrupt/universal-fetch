# Universal Fetch

`@inrupt/universal-fetch` is a TypeScript library for accessing the `fetch` method from any environment.

In browsers, this library will always re-export the existing `fetch` function from the global scope.

In Node.js environments, the library first checks if `fetch` is globally available ([as is the case in Node 18](https://nodejs.org/uk/blog/announcements/v18-release-announce/), and is being back-ported into Node 16), then the global `fetch` is used. Otherwise, the `fetch` function exported by [undici](https://www.npmjs.com/package/undici) is used for Node 16, and `node-fetch` is used for Node 14-and-below.

## Usage

```ts
import fetch, { Headers, Request, Response } from "@inrupt/universal-fetch";

const response = await fetch(url);
```
